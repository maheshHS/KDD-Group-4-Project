### Introduction to Problem or Opportunity
  

### Research Question(s) - Primarily, your research question should define the scope of your research, your data source and what you are seeking to discover.
##### Analyze the weekly data and monthly data of new listings, pending sales, homes sold, housing inventory, price and price drops in the data set of the hosing market before covid and after covid for county and metro region types and discover various changes  like in housing sales,  listings, inventory, price and real estate trends and also represent them visually using graphs.
#####  Predict what might be the state of different attributes like price , house sales, inventory from post covid housing market , using different machine learning techniques and visualize them using graphs. 

##### As  with Covid-19, Due to falling mortgage rates , the cost of borrowing money to buy a house is dropping. Also for people whose jobs weren’t negatively impacted were able to save more during quarantine times. Hence we need to study the Equity position of homebuyers and if there is any possibility of market to downturning post pandemic?

During a pandemic which houses will have a maximum drop down in price?and why?
Outcome :max distance to shop ,school and out of cities.

In which month will the maximum price drop or increase for rent and selling options?
Outcome:the month in which a pandemic has many cases, the price will increase.

Is it safe to expect that time-on-market (TOM) will have an unfavorable impact on price change?
Outcome: it will indirectly impact the sale options of housing .

Which price predictors  can be the deciding factor used to anticipate price changes, more clearly?
Outcome:building year , furnish, located in shop, no of rooms, and non contagious area

##### in the wake of COVID, the flight of people from densely populated cities in states,like New York and New Jersey has been fueled by fear of virus transmission, as well as newfound flexibility thanks to work-from-home policies.For those who’ve transitioned to permanent work-from-home status, the freedom to ditch high rents or mortgage costs in major cities for more affordable locationshas proved tempting. Thus we need to study what are the reasons of inbound moves and  how popularity of a relocation,destination have impacted real estate market?
