### Introduction to Problem or Opportunity
##### Amid all the uncertainty brought on by COVID-19, the pandemic has re-ordered real estate markets across the board on an unprecedented scale. No one could have predicted it. Not the economists, not the real estate agents, and especially not the nation’s homebuilders. But a pandemic definitely caused an emotional run on housing and more than one year after the Covid-19 crisis shut down and warped so much of American life, things are still unpredictable, but the outlook isn’t bright for housing. Home prices are overheated, mortgage rates are rising, the supply of homes for sale is anemic and consumer confidence in the housing market is falling.
  

### Research Question(s) - Primarily, your research question should define the scope of your research, your data source and what you are seeking to discover.
##### Analyze the weekly data and monthly data of new listings, pending sales, homes sold, housing inventory, price and price drops in the data set of the hosing market before covid and after covid for county and metro region types and discover various changes  like in housing sales,  listings, inventory, price and real estate trends and also represent them visually using graphs.
 
##### As  with Covid-19, Due to falling mortgage rates , the cost of borrowing money to buy a house is dropping. Also for people whose jobs weren’t negatively impacted were able to save more during quarantine times. Hence we need to study the Equity position of homebuyers and if there is any possibility of market to downturning post pandemic?
##### In the wake of Covid-19, the fear of Virus transmission have majorly impacted the house pricing for metro states like New York and New Jersey. Also due to work from home policies and for people transitioning their position to completely remote the freedom to ditch high rents or mortgage costs in major cities for more affordable locales has become tempting. Hence the question that leads study would be what are the reasons of inbound moves and  how popularity of a relocation destination have impacted real estate market?During a pandemic which houses will have a maximum drop down in price?and why?Outcome :max distance to shop ,school and out of cities.
##### Is it safe to expect that time-on-market (TOM) will have an unfavorable impact on price change?Outcome: it will indirectly impact the sale options of housing .
##### Which price predictors  can be the deciding factor used to anticipate price changes, more clearly?Outcome:building year , furnish, located in shop, no of rooms, and non contagious area
##### US residential housing market price changes during the COVID-19 crisis.On one hand, COVID-19 is an unprecedented negative shock to household’s incomes (both the current and the expected incomes due to massive layoffs), leading to a significant downward pressure on the housing price via the depressed demand. On the other hand, housing price can be higher during COVID-19 because of higher housing demand lower housing supply due to stay-at-home orders (and sellers reluctance to supply the houses out of COVID infection fears). Hence, it remains unclear a priori which force would dominate. So by using some methods we need to analyze the employment, income, share market and the location
